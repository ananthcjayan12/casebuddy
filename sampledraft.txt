Nandini Rao, aged 35, is married to Arun Rao, a successful businessman in Hyderabad. The couple has two daughters, aged 10 and 6. They live in a luxurious bungalow in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad. While their marriage initially appeared harmonious, it soon turned into a nightmare for Nandini as Arun's controlling and abusive behaviour escalated over time.

Arun has a history of anger management issues, which he initially hid from Nandini. Over the years, his behaviour worsened, leading to frequent outbursts of extreme violence, especially when he was under the influence of alcohol. Nandini, who was financially dependent on Arun, endured the abuse for the sake of her children and due to societal pressure.

In January 2024, Arun's abuse reached a critical point. After a business deal went wrong, Arun returned home in a drunken state and accused Nandini of being a bad omen for his business failures. He physically assaulted her, beating her with a metal rod, and when she attempted to escape, he locked her in a room without food or medical attention for two days. This was not the first time Arun had inflicted severe physical harm on Nandini. Previous incidents included breaking her arm, threatening her with a knife, and even choking her during arguments.

This latest incident left Nandini with multiple fractures, severe bruising, and a concussion. When she was finally able to escape with the help of a housemaid who alerted Nandini's brother, she was immediately taken to the hospital. The medical examination confirmed the extent of her injuries, and the doctors advised her to report the abuse to the authorities immediately.

Fearing for her life and the safety of her daughters, Nandini decided to file a lawsuit under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. She also filed a criminal complaint under relevant sections of the Bhartiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS).

Nandini's case is severe, and she seeks comprehensive legal protection and justice, including:

1. Protection Order: To ensure Arun is restrained from coming near her, her children, or her place of residence.
2. Residence Order: To secure her right to continue living in their shared household, while Arun is ordered to vacate the premises.
3. Monetary Relief and Compensation: To cover medical expenses, support her and her daughters, and compensate for the trauma and suffering caused by Arun’s actions.
4. Custody Order: To gain full custody of her daughters, ensuring their safety and well-being.
5. Criminal Prosecution: Under sections of the BNS, including Section 109 (Attempt to Murder), Section 117 (Voluntarily Causing Grievous Hurt by Dangerous Weapons or Means), and Section 85 (Husband or Relative of Husband of a Woman Subjecting Her to Cruelty).
Legal Considerations:
● Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA): Nandini’s lawyer will utilise the provisions of this act to obtain immediate protective measures, ensuring Arun cannot continue his abusive behaviour.
● Bhartiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS): The severe nature of the abuse, particularly the incident involving the metal rod, makes this a case of criminal assault, potentially attempted murder, and cruelty. These charges could result in significant legal consequences for Arun.
● Custody and Welfare of Children: Given the violence in the household, the court is likely to prioritise the safety and welfare of Nandini's daughters, potentially awarding her full custody.
